### Project Overview

The brain is unique to us all, which is why it is so difficult to grab everyone's attention and keep them entertained enough to remain focused. BrainBox is a refined study platform and entertainment party web-app that offers various forms of in game customizations. With a design similar to games such as Kahoot, Cards Against Humanity, and Quiplash, BrainBox offers various forms of interactions for all users. BrainBox is a platform with customizable features such as avatars, questions, answer styles, and team selections. With these features, box hosts will be able to customize previously created boxes, or create their own from scratch. BrainBox will combine the weight of entertainment with the need for education in order to provide box creators the ability to target their specific audiences.

### Project Goals:
We would like for this project to be a web-app that allows users to customize and create their own BrainBoxes. There will be a few template boxes that users can use and/or edit. The different answering styles we would like to provide initially will be basic fill in answers, multiple choice, and grid drawing. 

## Core Features
- Modular Player to Player Framework
- Multiple activities available
- Player Avatars and “Tags”
- Pattern recognition, Drawing (Pictionary-esque), Prompt-Response

### Approach
#### Tools/APIs/Frameworks
- React for frontend 
- Socket.io for backend 

#### User Experience
One user experience may be creating a game. The game host logs into their account and navigates to the game creation toolbox. From there, they interact with our sandbox tools to create a game that fits their needs. Once finished, they click "Create Game," after which they move to their created game library and click "Start Game".
